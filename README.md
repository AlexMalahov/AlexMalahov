## Motivated and meticulous Junior QA Tester with a solid foundation in software testing principles. Completed coursework/practical training in test design techniques, bug tracking, and basic SQL. Highly proactive, a fast learner, and passionate about contributing to product quality from the ground up. Eager to apply analytical skills and grow within a professional QA team.

## My education : I hold a certificate in Software Testing, having completed a comprehensive Basic QA Engineer course at Stepik. This foundational program equipped me with practical skills in the full software testing lifecycle. I gained hands-on experience in creating test documentation (test cases, checklists), reporting and tracking defects in Jira, and applying test design techniques. The course also provided me with essential technical knowledge, including API testing using Postman, writing basic SQL queries for data validation, understanding client-server architecture with DevTools, and working with version control systems (Git). This training solidified my understanding of Agile/Scrum methodologies and the QA role within the development process, forming a strong basis for my work as a tester.
